## Biography

Hi, I am **Yubo Dong**, a Master's student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, **Zhejiang University** (2023–2028), where I am advised by Prof. Yi Yang. 

My research primarily focuses on advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), with a strong emphasis on Multi-Agent Systems, structured reasoning, and model efficiency. I am passionate about building AI systems that can collaborate, reason efficiently, and solve highly complex dependencies—ranging from autonomous agents in Minecraft to highly efficient video diffusion models and hierarchical token pruning.
